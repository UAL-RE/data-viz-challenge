# Call for proposals

## Summary
This fellowship program is designed to address three known challenges in contemporary higher education:

+ Insufficient technical training for digital or data-intensive research within subject disciplines;
+ Uneven attention to digital pedagogy and strategies for teaching technical concepts within graduate training programs; and
+ A need for ongoing development of modular curricula for emerging technology that can be integrated into the classroom and extracurricular workshops, or used independently by scholars and researchers at the point of need.

## Eligibility
Graduate students at the University of Arizona who are enrolled full time in both Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 in any college or discipline.

## Time commitment
The program runs January 2020 through December 2020 and includes weekly meetings on Friday afternoons while classes are in session as well as self-directed learning time, with an estimated commitment of approximately 4 hours per week.

## Stipend
$1,500 total, disbursed in two installments.

## Deliverables
A public workshop in Fall 2020 and accompanying curricular materials that are made openly available online.
